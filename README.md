# Financial-Data-Analytics
Some small projects on Financial Data Analytics - Guidance Provided by Georgia State University Finance Department.

In these projects, there are statistical analyses and data manipulations to achieve the analysis of interest. 
In these analyses, there are regression methods: Simple, Multiple, Generalized, and Logistic regressions.
In addition, there are basic machine learning models where we train the data to achieve a certain outcome. This particular method can be found in the Credit Card Analysis and Detection R file, where the machine tries to identify credit card fraudulence based on 1312 data points.

R script files and Excel files will be provided for use. R files are in the main repository, while the Excel files are in the folder labeled "Data."
